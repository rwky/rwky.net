I've found Rowan almost by mistake on stackoverflow and discovered how amazing he is. I'm miles away from him, we speak only via email, and even on complicated Linux setups and few inputs from me, he was always available to fix issue. But this is not all, he not just fixes the issue but also tries to undestand more and help you further.. Also, he supports a vast array of O.S., virtualization types and webservers. Just fire him an email, and he will fix it for you! Thank you Rowan.

<p>Rowan has been the best programmer/admin I have ever worked with. He effortlessly picked up our site and understood what we were trying to achieve. Requests were done professionally and at lightning speeds! We had been let down by several developers previously, but Rowan has been fantastic. I can fully recommend his services.</p>

We used to manage our multitude of servers in-house and began to be overwhelmed with the number of server tweaks, security updates and performance issues requiring attention each week.

Since outsourcing our many cloud based servers to Rowan I no longer worry over server issues as I know that these will be handled expertly for me.

Through Rowan's intense dedication to server administration my business has benefited from lightning fast fixing of server issues, a solid and robust security implementation and a very pro active approach to maintenance.

In addition to monthly maintenance of our servers, Rowan has deployed multiple high-availability fail over servers, set up automatic backup systems, secured our systems against hack attempts and provided excellent and clear guidance on server strategy to avoid future problems and reduce our monthly server hosting fee!

Rowan is friendly, very patient at answering my many questions and provides a very reasonably priced service with an integrity rarely seen with remotely outsourced solutions.

I would whole heartedly recommend Rowan to anyone looking for server administration. Since moving our infrastructure on to Rowan's business we can concentrate on growing our own business!</div><div class="panel-footer">

Rowan is an absolute pleasure to work with. His quality of work is excellent, his reliability is really amazing: he's replied to every email I've sent within a few hours (and I send a lot of annoying emails at all times of day and night), got my site back up and running on a Sunday morning before I even knew there was a problem with it, etc. Having previously spent a lot time worrying about the reliability of my site, I now have no worries in this regard, which is a great relief and allows me to focus my worrying on many other aspects of my business instead. All in all, I'd highly recommend Rowan, he's the best web developer/server administrator I've had the opportunity to work with (and I've used quite a few at this stage!)</div><div class="panel-footer">

My network of entertainment and sports websites hosted on a Linode server recently had sudden and drastic increase in traffic. This caused multiple server crashes and lost revenue across my network of sites.  

I contacted Rowan in a panic for help.  He quickly responded and assured me that he could help.  After a quick look at my server, he was able to stop the crashes and presented a well documented plan to resolve my problems. The price quoted was within budget, so I asked him to proceed.

After Rowan implemented his changes, my server has since handled the multiple high traffic spikes with zero issues.  He has routinely followed up after high traffic days to continue to tweak my configuration without any prompting from me.

Rowan also answered all of my questions and concerns in a professional and concise way that I could understand, no matter how trivial.

Not only is my server running better than ever, but I was able to reduce the assigned memory by over 30% and save that on going cost.</div><div class="panel-footer">
